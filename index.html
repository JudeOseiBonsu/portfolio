            <p>
                I am a graduate Msc student from the school of computing and mathematics at the Keele 
                University,Staffordshire, United Kingdom. My research interest
                lie at the intersection of machine learning, 
                natural language processing and computer vision.

            </p>
            
            <br>

            <p>            

                In the past, I helped a publishing company 
                located in the UK to integrate
                a natural processing language in their workflow; which
                increased their productivity significantly.
            </p>

            <br>
            

            <p>            

                Prior to joining Keele University, I worked as 
                a data analyst in a mining company where I experienced
                practical applications of machine learning to solve
                real world challenges.

                I look forward to building more robust and efficient
                Ai systems.

            </p>




            <p>
               All my work or projects are focused on real world problems. I ocassionally 
               engage myself in research projects that lie within my fields of interest.

            </p>
            
            <br>

            <p>            

                When I am not working, I love to engage in outdoor activities such as hiking, travelling and 
                hanging out with my family.
            </p>

            <br>
            

            <p>            
                I look forward to taking on increasing responsibilities as I proceed ahead with my career.

                            This is the first prototype of an application that implements Dijkstra's 
                            shortest path algorithm to find the fastest route between any two stations for 
                            London's Underground Network.<br> <br>The algorithm estimates the time to travel 
                            between any two stations. I embedded an extra functionality that makes the 
                            algorithm adjust its search without having to pass through certain nodes or
                            stations.

                            This prototype is an application that has been integrated with a natural 
                            language processing system capable of analyzing texts to determine its 
                            suitability for readers(young, adults, middle-aged).<br> <br> The analyzer gives 
                            readability index, the age range, Grade and other statistics such as count
                            of profane words, word count, and others.<br> <br> It also has a recommender system 
                            embedded to help the reader find similar texts to the one being analysed. The 
                            project is currently on hold and I hope to work on it soon.
